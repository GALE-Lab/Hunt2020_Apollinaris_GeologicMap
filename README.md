# Hunt2020_Apollinaris_GeologicMap
Shapefiles and DEM associated with the publication "The lithified aeolian dune field adjacent to the Apollinaris Sulci, Mars: Geological history and paleo-wind record" by Hunt, Day, Edgett, and CHojnacki. Submitted to Icarus after revision in October 2021. 

Shapefiles contain information to reproduce the geologic map of preserved dunes south of Apollinaris Sulci, Mars

This repository includes a zipped folder with a 2 polyline shapefiles, and 1 polygon shapefile archiving measurements of transverse aeolian ridges, geologic contacts, dune crestlines, yardang trends, and geologic units in the region of preserved dunes in Apollinaris Sulci, Mars. 

This repository also includes a digital elevation model (DEM), digitally rectified graphic (DRG), and associated projection and world information. The DEM/DRG covers the paleodunes and was used to measure slopes and heights of the paleobedforms.
